# Acerola Dirt Jam Entry



## Method
 - When a new region is generated, n points are added to the global delaunay triangulation
 - Large-scale mesh is generated by sampling perlin noise at each of the verticies of each triangle
 - World mesh is sampled given a player pos and a render radius
 - Fine details then sampled using fractal perlin noise on the gpu on the vertex shader

## Later additions
 - Water simulation using https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1723-procedural-river-growing/
 - Each triangle can have either:
 - - No water flow
 - - 1 in edge, 1 out edge
 - - 2 in edges, 1 out edge
 - - Whole triangle is water (ocean)
 - - Whole triangle is water (lake)
 - Lake height depends on in flow, lake surface area (for evaporation), and height of neighboring edges
